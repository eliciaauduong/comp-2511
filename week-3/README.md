# Tutorial 3

## Lists

Refactor the code in `lists.ListExample` to make better use of Java `List`s

## Quick questions

1. What is method overriding?

We have a parent and child class (super and subclass) where the subclass reimplements a method from the superclass
Has to have same types arguments and number of arguments

2. Can you override a static method?

No

3. What is output by executing `A.f()` in the following?

   ```java
   public class A {
       public static void f() {
           C c = new C();
           c.speak();
           B b = c;
           b.speak();
           b = new B();
           b.speak();
           c.speak();
       }
   }
   ```

   ```java
   public class B {
      public void speak() {
          System.out.println("moo");
      }
   }
   ```

   ```java
   public class C extends B {
      public void speak() {
          System.out.println("quack");
      }
   }
   ```

> quack
> quack
> moo
> quack

4. What is output by executing `A.f()` in the following?

   ```java
   public class A {
       public static void f() {
           B b1 = new B();
           B b2 = new B();
           b1.incX();
           b2.incY();
           System.out.println(b1.getX() + " " + b1.getY());
           System.out.println(b2.getX() + " " + b2.getY());
       }
   }
   ```

   ```java
   public class B {
      private int x;
      private static int y;

      public int getX() {
          return x;
      }

      public int getY() {
          return y;
      }

      public void incX() {
          x++;
      }

      public void incY() {
          y++;
      }
   }
   ```

## Java Exercise

This exercise continues from the `Employee` exercise in the week 2 tutorial.

Create a `Manager` class that is a subclass of `Employee` and has a field for the manager's hire date.

> See code

- What constructors are appropriate?

- Is it appropriate to have a getter for the hire date? What about a setter?
