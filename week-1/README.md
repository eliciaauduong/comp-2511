# Tutorial 1

## Questions

1. What are the similarities and differences between C, Python and Java? Think in terms of the languages themselves but also style conventions and what they are used for?

2. What is a class? What is an object? Based on your experience with Python, how are classes typically used?

3. How do C, Python and Java compare to other languages you may have encountered at CSE or elsewhere? Is the best way of doing something in one language necessarily the best way of doing it in another?

## Programming

1. Briefly, what is an IDE?

2. Import [this tutorial](https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2511/20T3-tut01) into VSCode (just like you did/will do for the week 1 lab) and complete the hello world program. Things to note:
    * The JDK version used (java-11-openjdk on the CSE system; possibly jdk-11 on your laptop).
    * How new classes are created.
    * How VSCode's autocomplete gives detailed information about the methods that can be invoked.
    * Where the output appears.

3. Write a program that uses the `Scanner` class to read in a line of numbers separated by spaces and sums them.

4. Write a class that stores a message and has methods for getting the message, updating the message, printing it out and printing it out in all caps. Write a `main()` method for testing this class.
